Grep- use to search for particular strings in files. Ex: grep bool useString.cc to find the word bool in the file useString.cc

grep -i String use String.cc $|$ grep ostream. -i ignores case distinctions.

wc- word count. Ex: 14(lines) 58(words) 502(characters)

man wc- give manual of word count. Manuals have the description of the command, how to use it, and options for the command. Such as -l for the ls command. Everything has a manual page so they're useful when learning more about specific commands.

ctrl-d is the end of file command.

\section{Securify 2.0 GitHub}

\subsection{Main folder}

Dockerfile allows to select the required solc version. It installs basic packages, sets correct locale, installs tools, souffle, graphviz and pip, required solc version, securify requirements. The readme has a lot of important information like install instructions, usage, and supported vulnerabilities. There's the Solidity.bnf file. I had to look it up, but it's a Backus-Naur Form file so I need to research it a little bit more. It's used to write a formal representation of a context free grammar.

13. Write a grammar for the language consisting of strings that have n copies of the letter a followed by the same number of copies of the letter b, where n $>$ 0. For example, the strings ab, aaaabbbb, and aaaaaaaabbbbbbbb are in the language but a, abb, ba, and aaabb are not.\\
The language is $a^nb^n$, so the grammar would be : \\
S \rightarrow aSb | ab | $\lambda$\\
This satisfies the where n $>$ 0 and there will never be unequal amounts of a's or b's. \\

17. Convert the following EBNF to BNF: \\
S \rightarrow A\{bA\}\\
A \rightarrow a$[$b$]$A\\

In an EBNF, brackets mean optional parts. In a BNF this requires separate rules. \\
Braces indicates parts that can be repeated indefinitely or left out altogether. \\
BNF:\\
S \rightarrow A\\
\indent     |AbS\\
A \rightarrow aA\\
\indent |abA\\

23c. Compute the weakest precondition for each of the following assignment
statements and postconditions: c. a = a + 2 * b - 1 \{a $>$ 1\}

Substitute a + 2 * b -1 for a in the post condition, so;\\
a + 2b - 1 $>$ 1 \\
a + 2b $>$ 2 \\
2b $>$ 2 - a \\
b $>$ 1 - (a/2) \\

Therefore, the weakest precondition is \{b $>$ 1 - (a/2)\}
